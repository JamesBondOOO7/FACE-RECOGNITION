# FACE-RECOGNITION
This project can identify faces from a video feed using Haarcascade Classifier

# FACE-DETECTION
1. This uses a Haarcascade classifier object which is already trained and thus recognizes human faces.
2. Scaling is done accordingly, so that kernels( matrices involed in identifying facial features) work on
the pattern on which they were trained.
3. A rectangular boundary is also drawn on the faces according to the co-ordinates given by the Classifier.

# SNAPCHAT FILTERS
1. This time, instead of the whole face, features like the eyes and the nose are being detected by the classifier.
2. According to the co-ordinates given by the classifer, required functions are assigned to place the filters on the respective 
position of the face and resizing of the filters is also involved.
